<h5> XZ: figures below are just for fun </h5> </br>

Sunburst chart of industry biodiversity risk. The root (gics2 industry) starts from the center and children (gics4 and gics6 industries) are added to the outer rings. Compared to Figure A.4, the share of reports mention at the 6-digit industry level is the same. This plot adds up 6-digit scores to get 4-digit scores, while the figure in the paper is value-weighted.
