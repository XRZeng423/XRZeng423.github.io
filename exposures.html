<h5> XZ: figures below are just for fun. maybe we can only show the download paper and download data on this website </h5> </br>

Sunburst chart of industry biodiversity risk. The root (gics2 industry) starts from the center and children (gics4 and gics6 industries) are added to the outer rings. Compared to Figure A.4, the share of reports mention at the 6-digit industry level is the same and 4-digit and 2-digit values are different. This plot shows the sum of 6-digit shares. In Figure A.4, the 4-digit share is computed as the number of 4-digit companies that mention divided by the total number of 4-digit companies.
