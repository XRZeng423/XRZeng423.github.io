Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Government](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/government/) at the University of Texas at Austin. I received my M.A. in Government from the University of Texas at Austin in 2017 and my B.S. in Political Science from [Towson University](http://www.towson.edu) in 2015. My research interests include the U.S. Congress, political parties, intraparty organizations, agenda setting, the policy process, and social network analysis. I am also a Graduate Research Fellow with the [Policy Agendas Project](http://www.comparativeagendas.net), which actively maintains data series coded consistently for policy content to allow for comparisons over time.

My current research focuses on the role of intraparty organizations, like the House Freedom Caucus or the Congressional Progressive Caucus, in Congress. Specifically, I am interested in the role these organizations play in setting the congressional agenda, directing institutional attention, and organizing their resources to support their members' reelection efforts. My research showing the members of the House Freedom Caucus shifting their campaign resources to disproportionately support one another during the 2016 election won the "Best Paper by a Graduate Student" Award for the Annual Meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association in 2017.

Current projects, including working papers, can be found [here](/research/). Requests for drafts of working papers are welcome. To request a draft, please feel free to email me. If you would like a copy of my CV, it can be found [here](/McGee_CV.pdf).
