# Abstract
We explore the effects of physical and regulatory risks from biodiversity loss on economic activity and asset values. We first develop a news-based measure of aggregate biodiversity risk and analyze how it varies over time. We also construct and publicly release several firm-level measures of exposure to biodiversity risk, based on textual analyses of firms' 10-k statements and a large survey of financial professionals, regulators, and academics. Exposures to biodiversity risks vary substantially across industries in a way that is economically sensible and distinct from exposures to climate risk. We find evidence that biodiversity risks affect equity prices: returns of portfolios that are sorted on our measures of biodiversity risk exposures covary positively with innovations in aggregate biodiversity risk. However, our survey indicates that market participants do not perceive the current pricing of biodiversity risks to be adequate.
