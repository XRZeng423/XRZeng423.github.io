I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Government](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/government/) at the University of Texas at Austin. I received my B.S. in Political Science from [Towson University](http://www.towson.edu) in 2015. My research interests include the U.S. Congress, political parties, policy process, agenda setting, social network analysis, and elections. I am also a Graduate Research Fellow with the [Policy Agendas Project](http://www.comparativeagendas.net), which  actively maintains data series coded consistently to allow for comparisons over time.

Current projects, including working papers, can be found [here](/research/). Requests for drafts of working papers are welcome. To request a draft, please feel free to email me. If you would like a copy of my CV, it can be found [here](/McGee_CV.pdf).
