My research agenda is broad within the American politics and public policy subfields of political science. My main interests center on the role of political parties, especially within the U.S. Congress. Below are links to published works of mine as well as replication materials (where appropriate). Requests for drafts of working papers are welcome. Please feel free to email me your request.
